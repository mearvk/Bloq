<h1>APML API (application programmer interface)</h1>

<p>We pay two houses; the system/application housing and the GUI (pronounced "gooey") - the graphical user
    interface </p>

<h2>APML System Elements</h2>

<!-- Start of elements -->

<h3>The APML Element</h3>

<p>
    The APML System element [
<pre><code><apml></apml></code></pre>
] Elements.
    It acts both as a container and as a interface between your system(s) and hierarchically removed APML system.
    One APML Element usually to some few local systems and many APML Elements between systems that are derived
    independently is how the architecture is conceived.
    The APML Element is the base (root) element is therefore required for Bloq to forward compile the XML to Source
    Code.
</p>

<p>
    Example: <br><br>

    <apml>
        <system>
            <object>
            </object>
        </system>
    </apml>
</p>

<h4>The System Element</h4>

<p>
    The System element [
<pre><code><system></system></code></pre>
] is a intermediate housing element usually for developer defined System Elements.
    We care to include it to aid organization. A system element would contain many objects each of which could be simple
    or complicated like a program or server. Ok.
    The system element is quite standard and we would care to included it as part of regular practice. It is required
    for the time being.
</p>

<p>
    Example: <br><br>

<pre>
        <code>
            <apml>
                <system>
                    <object></object>
                </system>
                <system>
                    <object></object>
                    <object></object>
                    <object></object>
                </system>
            </apml>
        </code>
    </pre>

<h4>The Object Element</h4>

<p>
    The Object element [
<pre><code><object></object></code></pre>
] is a generic element used for developer defined Object Elements.
    Object Elements are useful because they can be extended, be specific or shallow and therefore are taught as a
    cornerstone of System Theory. Ok.
    Objects can be very general (a data structure) or they have larger scope like an HTTP server.
    When you have a more specific APML Element use it. In other cases use the Object Element. Ok.
</p>

<p>
    Example: <br><br>

<pre>
        <code>
            <apml>
                <system>
                    <object></object>
                </system>
            </apml>
        </code>
    </pre>

<h4>The Callback Element</h4>

<p>
    The Callback element [
<pre><code><callback></callback></code></pre>
] is an element used to set against an output a place for that output to be received as an input.
    Callback elements are well understood in software. We make use of them here because they are more or less a standard
    design pattern in Application and/or System Development.
    The Callback would have an output and a type tied usually to an Object Element and some other APML Element that
    would accept into a well understood data-structure the output of the first Object Element.
    The nature of the Callback element is to save time and to quickly wire inputs and outputs together where structural
    design would care to implement those guidingly for functional to follow or work with. Ok.
    Here we should note that the pattern is conceived flexibly and is written to be easily understood. Ok.
</p>

    Example: <br><br>

<pre>
        <code>
            <apml bodi="//loveboat/published/software/107876512/" repo="http://loveboat/sourcecode/107876512"

                </system>

<h4>Common XML Attributes</h4>

<p>
    Here we list common attributes for APML objects. Many APML objects will have similar base function that can be
    mapped in the XML itself. For instance, an
<pre><code><object></object></code></pre>
tag may have an id attribute, a Bodi String attribute and a class attribute however so may any other APML element. These
would be common to the core set of APML
objects since they are factually common to the System Design we are working with. Ok.

<ul>
    <li>id</li>
    <li>name</li>
    <li>bodi</li>
