<h1>APML API (application programmer interface)</h1>

<p>We pay two houses; the system/application housing and the GUI (pronounced "gooey") - the graphical user
    interface </p>

<h2>APML System Elements</h2>


<h3>The APML Element</h3>

<p>
    The APML System element [
<pre>
    <code>
        <apml></apml>
    </code>
    </pre>
    ] is a housing element usually for developer defined System [
    <system></system>
    ] Elements.
    It acts both as a container and as a interface between your system(s) and hierarchically removed APML system.
    One APML Element usually to some few local systems and many APML Elements between systems that are derived
    independently is how the architecture is conceived.
    The APML Element is the base (root) element is therefore required for Bloq to forward compile the XML to Source
    Code.
</p>

<p>
    Example: <br><br>

    <apml>
        <system>
            <object>
            </object>
        </system>
    </apml>
</p>

<h3>The System Element</h3>

<p>
    The System element [
<pre>
    <code>
        <system></system>
    </code>
    </pre>
    ] is a intermediate housing element usually for developer defined System Elements.
    We care to include it to aid organization. A system element would contain many objects each of which could be simple
    or complicated like a program or server. Ok.
    The system element is quite standard and we would care to included it as part of regular practice. It is required
    for the time being.
</p>

<p>
    Example: <br><br>

<pre>
    <code>
        <apml>
            <system>
                <object></object>
            </system>
            <system>
                <object></object>
                <object></object>
                <object></object>
            </system>
        </apml>
    </code>
    </pre>
</p>

<h3>The Object Element</h3>

<p>
    The System element [
<pre>
    <code>
        <object></object>
    </code>
    </pre>
    ] is a generic element used for developer defined Object Elements.
    Object Elements are useful because they can be extended, be specific or shallow and therefore are taught as a
    cornerstone of System Theory. Ok.
    Objects can be very general (a data structure) or they have larger scope like an HTTP server.
    When you have a more specific APML Element use it. In other cases use the Object Element. Ok.
</p>

<p>
    Example: <br><br>

<pre>
    <code>
        <apml>
            <system>
                <object></object>
            </system>
        </apml>
    </code>
    </pre>
</p>

<h3>The Callback Element</h3>

<p>
    The Callback element [
<pre>
    <code>
        <callback></callback>
    </code>
    </pre>
    ] is an element used to set against an output a place for that output to be received as an input.
    Callback elements are well understood in software. We make use of them here because they are more or less a standard
    design pattern in Application and/or System Development.
    The Callback would have an output and a type tied usually to an Object Element and some other APML Element that
    would accept into a well understood data-structure the output of the first Object Element.
    The nature of the Callback element is to save time and to quickly wire inputs and outputs together where structural
    design would care to implement those guidingly for functional to follow or work with. Ok.
    Here we should note that the pattern is conceived flexibly and is written to be easily understood. Ok.
</p>

<p>
    Example: <br><br>

<pre>
    <code>
        <apml bodi="//loveboat/published/software/107876512/" repo="http://loveboat/sourcecode/107876512"
              readme="http://loveboat/readme/107876512">
        <system>
            <object bodi="//object001/" input="none" output="./functions/function001" inputparametertype="none"
                    outputparametertype="java.lang.String"/>

            <object bodi="//object002/" input="./functions/function001" output="none"
                    inputparametertype="java.lang.String" outputparametertype="none"/>

            <callback bodi="//callback001" input="//object001/functions/function001"
                      output="//object002/functions/function001" methodname="callmeback" parametertype="infer"/>
        </system>
    </apml>
    </code>
    </pre>
</p>

<h3>The Producer Element</h3>

<p>
    The Producer element [
<pre>
    <code>
        <producer></producer>
    </code>
    </pre>
    ] is an element used to set against an output a place for that output to be received as an input.
    Callback elements are well understood in software. We make use of them here because they are more or less a standard
    design pattern in Application and/or System Development.
    The Callback would have an output and a type tied usually to an Object Element and some other APML Element that
    would accept into a well understood data-structure the output of the first Object Element.
    The nature of the Callback element is to save time and to quickly wire inputs and outputs together where structural
    design would care to implement those guidingly for functional to follow or work with. Ok.
    Here we should note that the pattern is conceived flexibly and is written to be easily understood. Ok.
</p>

<p>
    Example: <br><br>

    <!--
    /1* (root element)
    //2 (child element - 2nd degree)
    //1 (child element - 2nd degree)
    ///3 (child of child element - 3rd degree)
    ///3
    //1
    //2
    //1 (child element - 2nd degree)
    //1 (closure element - 2nd degree)
    /1* (closure root element 1st degree)

    //satisfied as correct markup language if a hierarchically (1st order with 1st order, 2nd order with 2nd order, etc.) aware push/pop stack implementation would work (see below)

    /1*  push
    //2  push
    //1  push
    ///3 push
    ///3 pop

    ...

    //2  pop
    //1  push
    //1  pop
    /1*  pop

    //such that every push at hierarchy N would eventually find a matching 'pop' at hierarchy level N for every element in the markup document

    //so a stack worked like a paper stack - the last thing you added was on top and the first thing was on the bottom

    //as soon as you had a hierarchical match you would pop - the rest would push onto stack


    ///3   (push 4)
    //1    (push 3)
    //2    (push 2)
    /1*    (push 1)

    becomes...

    ///3   (pop 1) -> remove this from stack because we have hierarchical match now (two ///3's). ok.
    ///3   (push 4)
    //1    (push 3)
    //2    (push 2)
    /1*    (push 1)

    becomes...

    //1    (push 3)
    //2    (push 2)
    /1     (push 1)

    becomes...

    //1    (pop 2)
    //1    (push 3)
    //2    (push 2)
    /1     (push 1)

    becomes...

    //2    (push 2)
    /1     (push 1)

    becomes...

    //2    (pop 3)
    //2    (push 2)
    /1     (push 1)

    becomes...

    /1     (push 1)

    becomes...

    //1    (push 5)
    /1     (push 1)

    becomes...

    //1    (pop 4)
    //1    (push 5)
    /1     (push 1)

    becomes...

    /1     (push 1)

    becomes...

    /1*    (pop 5)
    /1*    (push 1)

    becomes push.count == pop.count && root element == root.element (ok as complete STACK)

    Another data structure is a QUEUE

    QUEUEs worked another way; the first person in was the first person served and the last person in was the last person served.

    In computer Science there are many interesting data structures.  Depending on your requirement you would choose a stack or a queue.

    If you wanted, for instance, to implement a series of function calls (a calls b calls c calls d calls e and a is the last to complete since we must complete b-e first) what would you use and why? Ok.  Try to answer.

    //get groceries (function a )
        //must have find car keys ( function b )
            //must have be at home ( function c )
        //must have wallet ( function d )
            //must have money in it ( function e )

    //hints?

    ok - 3 minutes

    /a
    //b
    ///c
    //d
    ///e

    could be written as a STACK? YES/NO (might be hard to imagine)

    could be written as a QUEUE? YES/NO (easy to imagine or is it)

    So this is computer science - why choose one or the other?  Hmm.  Let's see.

    First as a stack YES, yes we could write this as a STACK:

    /a (a starts) -> implies we are going to get groceries
    //b (b starts) -> implies we need to find keys
    ///c (c starts) -> implies we need to be sure the keys are around
    ///c (c finishes) -> implies we are sure the keys are around somewhere
    //b (b finishes) -> implies we found the keys
    //d (d starts) -> implies wallet is around
    ///e (e starts) -> implies we are pretty sure there is money in our wallet
    ///e (e finishes) -> implies we are now 100% sure there is money in our wallet
    //d (d finishes) -> implies we find the wallet
    /a (a finishes) -> implies we can go out to get groceries!

    Now isn't that pretty?

    We would submit that yes, that is pretty. 'a' depends on b so we can imagine that b is a child of proper ordering ergo /a imples //b BUT //b also implies ///c doesn't it?

    BUT /a also implies d implies e so we can order these as a STACK because as each function/method is completed its STACK pop will functionally equate to its completion - neat isn't it?

    Callbacks stuff the return values into a memory address instead of a stack's popped return value (a direct function return value).  We ask to be "called back" when the program is ready and check our address for readiness! Ok.

    Intuitively a QUEUE could also be used for STACK functionality:

    QUEUE 'A' could be used like:

    QUEUE A [ A + QUEUE B [ B + QUEUE C ] ] [ A + QUEUE D [ D + QUEUE E ] ]

    QUEUE A [ A + QUEUE B [ B + QUEUE C ] ] [ A + QUEUE D [ D + QUEUE E ] ]

    Which is to say you could have a queue for queues at each point the stack became deeper by a degree and when those queues were satisfied the original value could go:

    A - > B

    B - > C

    A - > D

    D - > E

    Ok? A implies B and B implies C and A also implies D which implies E. Ok.

    So taking this up like a queue we would have A, B, C, D, E respective or A, D, E, B, C.  Ok.  So yes, you could write it up quickly as an ordered list or QUEUE.

    <code>
    <apml>
        <system>
                <object bodi="//object001/" input="/input" output="/output" inputclass="java.lang.String" outputclass="java.lang.String"/>

                <object bodi="//object002/" input="/input" output="/output" inputclass="java.lang.String" outputclass="java.lang.String"/>

                <object bodi="//object003/" input="/input" output="/output" inputclass="java.lang.String" outputclass="java.lang.String"/>

                <callback bodi="//callback001" input="//object001" output="//object002"/>

                <callback bodi="//callback002" input="//object002" output="//object003"/>
        </system>
    </apml>
    </code>
