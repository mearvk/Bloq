<p>
    Hello. Now would be a great time to learn how this whole API works. Good thinking.

</p>

<p>

    APML (application markup language) is a new idea in the world of software and an old one. We would like to welcome
    you to learn this idiom and begin using it well. Ok.

    APML is a markup language for applications. We care to describe (markup) the way a program will be structured. APML
    is this language and idiom.

    For many years programmer's have begun with functional system design with narrow, prescribed system theory (nouns,
    verbs, states as objects, functions and values).

    We find this approach used with great frequency. Many programmer's are taught this theory or approach in Systems
    Theory as an introduction to software design.

    Fortunately with some 10 or 15 years of experience one begins to consider learning one's own way in design and
    approach to creating proper and complete system design.

    Let's talk plainly about what APML is and what it is not.
</p>

<p>
    APML is an XML extension addressing structural objects, functions and values in software developement. XML is not a
    new idea but using it to prescribe correct syntax for your program is.

    We will look at some examples but quickly it divides primarily into two system areas. Primarily we address general
    application development in software. Secondly we will address user interfaces in application development.

    We address these values because they are the cornerstones of modern software: a underlying program and its visual
    representation.

</p>

<p>
    APML is therefore:

<ul>

    <li>a structural application language: we define the structure based on well understood system elements and then we
        consider what will be required in terms of functional coding.
    </li>

    <li>a solution for managing programming complexity: in the event that system requirement branches into greater depth
        or breadth we would like to be able to add structural recourse easily and quickly.
    </li>

    <li>an innovation in the world of XML: we know have a quick, real-time solution for creating program structure.</li>

    <li>an evolutionary leap in the world of software development: quickly now with the ease of XML, programmer's can
        develop software in a fraction of the time.
    </li>

    <li>a bold new standard in system theory: system theory is now itself event driven - when we conceive of new objects
        we may add them to APML itself.
    </li>

    <li>a way for system theory to converge into something beautiful and useful: the more APML is used the more and
        greater feedback we acquire - natural logarithm of natural logarithm is unit
    </li>

    <li>a way for software to always be available, anywhere in time or space for millenia to come: with BODI, another
        great technology we are releasing, we have safeguards towards future state, future technology and the like!
    </li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
    APML is a new technology and will be eventually released with several other key system components. APML brother
    technology like Runyn, Bloq, Bodi, Fallthru and more will eventually house all key system precepts in an ordered and
    simple way forever.

    Because these technologies are new we will not have all answers all at once. In fact life is sometimes
    <i>exactly</i> that idiom even oftsometimes in system design and development!

    We will be Captaining many great technologies in turn but we bid that you understand that a software stack will not
    be greater than the time it is written in. Giving that some thought let's see what's available for us tomorrow but
    not quite today.
</p>

<p>
    APML is not therefore:

<ul>

    <li>a "fix it" despite poor prior captaining: we cannot yet take any functional code or system and "reverse compile"
        it backwards to a perfect and graceful system in the "APML-verse".
    </li>

    <li>a total solution for world of software: we cannot safeguard mankind against unintentional misuse of system
        design.
    </li>

    <li>a total security blanket, a new mysterious "security hole" or unfair business practice: here finally what we
        design is what we design. Quality is a function of you and your understanding not this paradigm.
    </li>

    <li>a whole, complete treatise on system development: correctness is still defined by you, the programmer - system
        elements and indeed APML elements themselves can be defined as we take up system theory in wholer cloth.
    </li>

    <li>a solution for integrating with broken, outdated and/or poorly designed softawre: we do not address hacking DLLs
        or such - forward compliance is where we left it - with those who understand its value!
    </li>

</ul>
